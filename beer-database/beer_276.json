Cascade, Northern Brewer and Falconer's Flight hops provide a hint of citrus and are perfectly complimented by a strong malt profile.  A 6.9% ABV adds a refreshing brightness to the beer while stopping just shy of the high alcohol levels of a double or imperial IPA.  Crisp, refreshing and well balanced, we are proud to put fourth our IPA as part of the American craft beer revival.",

We start with a copper-hued malt base of California-grown, two-row barley, German Vienna Malt, Crystal Malts and Biscuit Malt. Then we start layering on the hops—grown all along the west coast in California, Oregon and Washington. We combine Magnum, Chinook, Cascade, El Dorado and Simcoe to create our own unique twist on the IPA style with intense aromas of grapefruit and tangerine peel, pineapple and pine trees. The finish has a clean bitterness and light saltine cracker note.",

        "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",
